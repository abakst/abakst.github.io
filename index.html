      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>I received my Ph.D. after six years in
        the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/">Programming
        Systems</a> group at UCSD. I am currently a senior engineer at Qualcomm, where I work on compilers targeting the Adreno family of GPUs.
      </p>


      <p>
        For my Ph.D. I worked on building tools that automatically
        prove properties of paramaterized concurrent message-passing programs. The approach works by automatically computing a sequentialized variant of the program that is easier to verify than the naive product construction. The sequential program serves as a proof of shallow properties such as deadlock freedom and local assertion safety. We are currently working on extending our approach to verify deeper functional correctness properties of interesting programs, such as consensus protocols.

      <p>
        In the past, I have worked on
        <a href="http://goto.ucsd.edu/csolve">CSolve</a>, 
        which is a verifier for C programs based on <a href="http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/papers/low_level_liquid_types.html">Low-Level
        Liquid Types, a refinement type system with decidable inference</a>. I have also worked on <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/">Liquid Haskell</a>,
        a refinement type system for Haskell programs.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I graduated from MIT in 2008 with an S.B. in Computer
      Science, and again in 2009 with an M.Eng (<a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/53142">thesis</a>). After
      graduation, I worked at Oracle with a fantastic group of people
      developing a cluster filesystem for Windows, Linux, AIX, and
      Solaris. It was at this time that I became interested in
      programming languages and program analysis, especially with
      respect to analyzing systems software.
